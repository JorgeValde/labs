I begin running the SAS programs.

NE Control_1 
I made a copy of the original and I'm working on the file called NE Control_1 JV

I change the name of the directory in the first line to:
G:\MAX-Filer\Research\Labs-kbuzard-S18 
then I run the entire program one step at a time.
Started runing at 10.40 am ended at 10.53 am. If I run the entire program it takes less than 3 minutes. 
I added the Procedure Print the variable citations at the end of the program to see the result.
Correctly print a table. 

After running the whole program step by step, I start checking it by printing some of the variables, 
the program print the tables but it take beetwen 10-15 min per table, if it takes longer than that I cancel the printing. 

The next step should be to transpone the columns so the table looks like the one in the paper we are using.
I assume this is done in the later programs. 

The program has some value that are not referenced in the code. 

Line 124, col 34. I got this message "WARNING: The variable appyear in the DROP, KEEP, or RENAME list has never been reference"
Line 179, col 25. I got this message "WARNING: The variable o_gday in the DROP, KEEP, or RENAME list has never been referenced".
Line 179, col 25. I got this message "WARNING: The variable o_gmonth in the DROP, KEEP, or RENAME list has never been referenced".

Line 190-192 got this message "Input data set is already sorted, no sorting done". 
I don't think it matter much, it just unneccesary. 

Line 195, col 52.  I got this message "Variable o_gday is uninitialized"
Line 195, col 59.  I got this message "Variable o_gmonth is uninitialized"

Line 213-215 got this message "Input data set is already sorted, no sorting done". 

Once the program finish running
I ADDED the last proccess to the code to print the final table "citations". Line 220.
In this table all the variables mantioned in the warnings have inputs (they are not empty).



I begin looking at the second program. NE Control_2_WR_MonthDay_intl_182 
Same as before 
I made a copy of the original and I'm working on the file called NE Control_2_WR_MonthDay_intl_182 JV

I change the name of the directory in the firts line to:
G:\MAX-Filer\Research\Labs-kbuzard-S18 

I run the program one step a time until I reach the 4# matching, after that I run the remaining 16# all together.
The program runs good but there are some warnings in the code.

It takes 8 minutes to run the full code. 
I try printing the last table (I added this proccess) but after 20 mins waiting I cancel the proccess.
