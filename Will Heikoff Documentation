Goal: To get the python script K-function Local, G:\MAX-Filer\Research\Labs-kbuzard-S18\kfunctions\K-function Local, 
	for California R & D Labs running for 9 iterations

Searched for file which exhibits the zip code with the associated Total and manufacturing employment for the zip code.

6/15/18  - NOTE: skip ahead to 6/21 to avoid mistakes with non-scipy functions and adjust for proper line placement
Found zip code file for line 22: ZIPS.shp, using trial and error methods testing different files with the name ‘zips’ 
	within the California folder, plugging the files into the ArcMap file ‘Base’, located within the same folder, 
	to find a file which exhibits the zip code with the associated Total and manufacturing employment for the zip code.
	Located at G:\MAX-Filer\Research\Labs-kbuzard-S18\CARR\California\Base Data
Entered ZIPS.shp into line 22
Found labs data for line 23: Labs.shp, using trial and error methods testing different files with the name ‘zips’ within 
	the California folder, plugging the files into the ArcMap file ‘Base’, located within the same folder, to find a file 
	which exhibits the Labs street address and associated ‘X’ and ‘Y’ cooridinates
	Located at G:\MAX-Filer\Research\Labs-kbuzard-S18\CARR\California\Base Data
Entered Labs.shp into line 23
Entered ‘ZIP’ on Line 26 for variable name, after plugging in the ‘ZIPS.shp’ file into ArcMap and using the attribute Table to
	establish what the zip code variable was
Entered variable names ‘X’ and ‘Y’ variable names into respective spots on line 47-48, after plugging the ‘Labs.shp’ file into 
	ArcMap and using the attribute Table to establish what the Coordinate variables are
Set simulations to 9 on Line 39
Put parenthesis around all ‘print’ lines to adjust for the syntax change from Python 2.7 to 3.6
Set Python Path by going to Tools and then “PYTHONPATH manager”; adding path ‘C:\Program Files (x86)\ArcGIS\Desktop10.5’ 
	therefore allowing spyder to import Arcpy
Set Python Path using “PYTHONPATH manager”; adding path ‘G:\MAX-filer\Research\Labs-kbuzard-S18\kfunctions’ therefore allowing 
	spyder to import kfunctions

Troubleshooting issue with arcpy.env; Spyder has the issue “AttributeError: module 'arcpy' has no attribute 'env' “

6/21/18
Replaced kfunction, K-function Local, and K-function Global with kfunction_scipy, K-function Local_scipy, and K-function_scipy, 
	to help resolve the issue locating the ‘env’ attribute for arcpy

6/22/18
Entered “G:\MAX-Filer\Research\Labs-kbuzard-S18\CARR\California\Base Data\ZIPS.shp” into Line 37 to set the areal features
Entered “G:\MAX-Filer\Research\Labs-kbuzard-S18\CARR\California\Base Data\Labs.shp” into Line 38 to set the point features
Replaced “Population” Line 43 with “ZIP” to set the fieldname
Entered “9” for number of simulations on Line 46
Replaced (.1, 1, .1) with [0.5, 1, 5, 10] on Line 31 to adjust the distance vector to 0.5 miles, 1 miles, etc…
Entered “”X”, “Y”” into pointFeatures.shapes function on line 65 to set coordinates
Troubleshooting problem associated with "PVALS" syntax error on Line 184

6/24/18
Made adjustments to Documentation, including additions of flagposts to avoid prior mistakes
Replaced “ZIP” as fieldname with “Emp_Manufa” as the data that we are using to establish the correct
	proportions for how many labs are randomized into each zip code involves using the manufacturing employment
Added SETX functions on lines 11 and 12 to eliminate the necessity for “point and click buttons"
Added “#” border on lines 8 and 9 to separate sections for setting the path
Added section description on line 10
NOTE: that last three adjustments pushes all lines down by 7 lines
Replaced “G:\MAX-Filer\Research\Labs-kbuzard-S18\CARR\California\Base Data\Labs.shp” with “G:\MAX-Filer\Research\
	Labs-kbuzard-S18\CARR\California\Base Data\GoodLabs.shp” on line 45 to adjust to the further refined list of R&D
	Labs in GoodLabs.shp, as noted in the Journal of Urban Economics article, The agglomeration of American R&D labs,
	by Buzard et al. which sites the use of only 645 labs rather than the 687 labs given in Labs.shp
Continuing troubleshooting issue with PVAL syntax issue on line 191
