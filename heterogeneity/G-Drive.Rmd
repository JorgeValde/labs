#### Python Scripts Folder

-   **stat_calc1.stats** (STATS):

-   **Address_ID** -- Preparing and cleaning addresses

-   **clust_pat_maker** -- Python Script to read in patent data and conduct a spatial join with clusters then keep the patents that fall into those clusters as geodataframes and export them

-   **countSim_speedUP** -- Point Count Simulation Computation. It turns the dictionary back into a dataframe.

-   **countSim_tester** -- Same as "countSim_speedUpr:" but measure the time for each individual loop and the entire system (time it takes to preform the simulation).

-   **field_org** -- Read in 1997 cattell lab data as well as my geocoded data and combine the two to produce geodataframes (gdf) for each technology field in the cattell directory which then get saved as shapefile currently the program is set in such a way so as to produce gdfs for the country wide data and gdfs for california and the NE corridor the script will then take the dictionary containing the california labs by field and save each gdf as a shapefile.

-   **firm_struc** -- Reads in the 1997 Catteell directory data produced by Ivan Png 2016. It takes the data in this data set of American R&D Labs and organizes it based on firm structure. The final product is an Exceell File that gets outputted.

-   **GeoCode_OCR**

-   **GeoCoder** -- Iterate through the address data and geocode each input address.

-   **pngwork** -- create dataframe for firms that have at most 2 establishments, this will become the dataframe for firms with only one research establishment.

-   **Prep_Labs** -- python script which reads in two csv of geocoded labs and joins them resulting in a pandas dataframe. Then it takes the coordinates for the labs in the dataframe and creates a geometry column to turn the df into a geodataframe it then saves the resulting geodataframe as a shapefile.

-   **Prep_ZBP** -- python script that uses pandas and geopandas packages to read in census manufacturing employment data at the ZCTA level and shapefile of all ZCTA bounderies in the contiguous US. The employment data is prepared and the merged into the shapefiles data table resulting in a geopandas geodataframe which gets saved as a shapefile.

-   **shapeStich** -- create the new geodataframe by appending all state level gdfs.

-   **shapify** -- Reads in a csv file that contains point data in latitude and longitude form and converts them into geopandas geodataframe the result is then exported as a shapefile.

-   **stat_calc** -- Read in the point file and associated cluster files produced after running the 3Stage_Local program and calculates various statistics from it. Different sections of this program produce different stats and have been partitioned and commented accordingly.

-   **state_code_rep** -- Fix the state_code column of the cattell png data for 1997

-   **usa_block_emp** - reads in a list of csv files containing employment data at the block level. It then reads in a shape file of all US census block boundaries and merges the employment data into the shapefiles data table and saves the resulting geodataframe as a shapefile.
